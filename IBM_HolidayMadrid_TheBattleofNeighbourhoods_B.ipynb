    "Madrid is one of the most turistic cities across Europe. Every year hundreds of thousands of people visit the capital of Spain so as to enjoy the people there, try new and tasty dishes and spend their time doing sightseeing while benefit the weather. Nowadays, travelling to a different country on vacation is not seen as a high-class activity considering the appearance of low-cost airlines and the globalization process of the early 21st century. However, it is still difficult for people to optimize their housing expenses when they haven't been in that city before. Moreover, Those readers that have visited Madrid as some point could agree with me that it is really difficult to visit every place in a short period of time. Apart from that, depending on the neighbourhood of Madrid your place is located on it could significantly vary the amount of money paid.\n",
